# YouTube Clone

![YouTube Clone](./screenshots/image.png)

This web app is a Youtube clone developed using `React`, [Material UI](https://mui.com/) and the [RapidAPI's Youtube API v3](https://rapidapi.com/ytdlfree/api/youtube-v31). On here you are able to,

- Search for videos
- Watch videos from the different categories available in the sidebar.
- You'll also find a recommended videos section when you watch a video.

This is my first showcase project. The main objective behind working on this project is to showcase my skills and knowledge in `React` and `MaterialUI` and personally to practice more on the same.

## Clone a clone?

### Clone the project

Clone the project in a folder in your system.

Go to the project directory.

```bash
cd youtube-clone
```

### RapidAPI Setup

1. First up go to [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com) and create your account.
1. Subscribe to [Youtube v3](https://rapidapi.com/ytdlfree/api/youtube-v31) API
1. Go to Endpoints and from the Code Snippets section copy the `X-RapidAPI-Key`.
1. Paste the key in the `youtube-clone/.env` file of the app.
1. All done!

Back to your terminal!

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you are in the project directory `/youtube-clone` before you execute the below command.

```bash
npm install
```

### Run it in your system!

```bash
npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
